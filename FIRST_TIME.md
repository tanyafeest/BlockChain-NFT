We are using `yarn` workspace, as installing things via npm **will result in broken dependencies.**

> If you want to know how KodaDot works go to the [DOCS](https://docs.kodadot.xyz/).

# Hyper start üöÄ

### Prerequisites üéí

```md
node >= 14
yarn üß∂
```

Copy and paste this commands to your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery.git nft-gallery
cd nft-gallery;
yarn;
```
It will clone your project and install all dependencies.

to start the server, run:
```bash
yarn dev
```
**KodaDot will be available at [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).**

### Starting dev server with the pinning functionality üì¶
If you want to use the pinning functionality, first you have to create a `.env` file in your project root.
```bash
echo 'NUXT_ENV_KEYRING=true
      PINATA_API_KEY=
      PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
      PINATA_MASTER=' > .env
```

Functions are located in `src-functions/`

**[You can obtain Master Pinata Keys here](https://app.pinata.cloud/keys)**

you need to install the netlify-cli:
```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

to start the server, run:
```bash
netlify dev
```

**App will start on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).**

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice for contributors before 15/01/2022 ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you've had contributed before **15/01/2022 and have older fork of** `nft-gallery` there are currently two strategies to be up-to-date

- Easiest - [Delete your fork and fork it as as new.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)
- Harder - [Sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)

## Docker üê≥

If you just want to try out our KodaDot on Kusama and have a full local setup with a local node, we assume you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and docker-compose installed.

- ### First time setup

  - Build the docker image

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are logged into docker.

    docker-compose up --build
    ```

  - To check if container is up:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

- ### From next time

  Simply run:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

Voila! KodaDot will be available at [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).
KodaDot supports Hot Module Replacement on docker as well, any changes made will take effect immediately.

## Dev hacks (FAQ) ü¶á

**1. How can I read some data from the GraphQL?**

Every `.graphql` file is located in the `src/queries/`.

```graphql
query nftByIdMinimal($id: String!) {
  nFTEntity(id: $id) {
    id
    currentOwner
    price
  }
}
```
To use it inside the `.vue` file, we can import it like a normal module:
For the specific purposes we need to also import the `PrefixMixin`. Thanks to that app knows which indexer is using.

> PrefixMixin is only applicable to the SubQuery indexers. To use SubSquid please use client: 'subsquid' in the query call.

Then we can use it like this:

```html
<script lang="ts">
import { Component, mixins } from 'nuxt-property-decorator'

import nftByIdMinimal from '@/queries/nftByIdMinimal.graphql'
import PrefixMixin from '~/utils/mixins/prefixMixin'

@Component({})
export default class GalleryItem extends mixins(PrefixMixin) {
  id: string = ''
  nft: NFT = emptyObject<NFT>()

  async fetch() {
    const { data } = await this.$apollo.query({
      client: this.urlPrefix,
      query: nftByIdMinimal,
      variables: { id: this.id },
    })

    this.nft = data.nFTEntity
    console.log('nft', this.nft)
  }
}
</script>
```

**2. How can I read on-chain data from the RPC node?**

```html
<script lang="ts">
import { Component, Vue } from 'nuxt-property-decorator'
import Connector from '@kodadot1/sub-api'

@Component({})
export default class GalleryItem extends Vue {
  id = '0'
  collectionId = '0'

  async fetch() {
    const { api } = Connector.getInstance()
    const nft = await api.query.uniques.asset(this.collectionId, this.id)
    console.log('nft', nft)
  }
}
</script>
```

**3. Is it possible to subscribe to the on-chain data from the RPC node?**

```html
<script lang="ts">
import { Component, mixins } from 'nuxt-property-decorator'
import SubscribeMixin from '@/utils/mixins/subscribeMixin'

@Component({})
export default class GalleryItem extends mixins(SubscribeMixin)  {
  id = '0'
  collectionId = '0'

  async created() {
    this.subscribe(
      api.query.uniques.asset,
      [this.collectionId, this.id],
      (nft: any) => console.log(nft) // callback which returns the data
    )
  }
}
</script>
```

**4. How can I make an on-chain transaction?**

In order to execute some transaction you can use `exec` located in `src/utils/transactionExecutor.ts`
Usage:

```html
<script lang="ts">
import { Component, mixins } from 'nuxt-property-decorator'
import MetaTransactionMixin from '@/utils/mixins/metaMixin'
// import AuthMixin from '~/utils/mixins/authMixin' // get currently logged in account

import Connector from '@kodadot1/sub-api'

@Component({})
export default class GalleryItem extends mixins(MetaTransactionMixin)  {

  async submit() {
    const cb = api.tx.system.remark
    const args = 'Hello World'

    await this.howAboutToExecute(
      this.accountId, // sender can be obtained from the AuthMixin
      cb,
      [args],
      (blockNumber) => console.log(`Remark ${args} saved in block ${blockNumber}`)
    )
  }
}
</script>
```

**5. How can I test Kodadot without spending KSM?**

[You can obtain some Westend (WND)](https://matrix.to/#/#westend_faucet:matrix.org)

You can change the network in the navbar.
Currently supported networks are `kusama, westend, statemine, westmint`.

## Running local Polkadot and subquery nodes

To run the full local environment we recommend you to run a [polkadot/Kusama node](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot).
In case you are using Apple M1, we have a [tutorial for that üçè ](https://vikiival.medium.com/run-substrate-on-apple-m1-a2699743fae8)

Current Indexers we have/use:
- SubSquid
  - RMRK: [rubick](https://github.com/kodadot/rubick)
- SubQuery
  - RMRK: [magick](https://github.com/vikiival/magick)
  - Statemine (Unique NFT pallet): [unique](https://github.com/kodadot/unique)
